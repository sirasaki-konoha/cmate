# Project configuration file (auto-generated by 'gmk --init')
# ======================================================

# [Required] Project name (used for executable name)
project = "gmk"

# [Required] C compiler to use (gcc/clang/etc)
compiler = "gcc"

# Compiler flags (optimization, warnings, include paths, etc)
flags = "-Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -O2 -g "

# Source directories containing .c files
# Default: ["src"] (if not specified)
# Multiple directories can be specified
# src = ["src"]

# Include directories containing .h files
# Default: ["include"] (if not specified)
# Multiple directories can be specified
include = ["include", "external/tomlc99/"]

# [Advanced] Specific files to compile (overrides automatic src discovery)
# Use this to compile particular files when auto-detection isn't desired
# Example: ["src/main.c", "src/utils.c"]
compile = ["external/tomlc99/toml.c"]

# External libraries to link against (-l flag will be added automatically)
# Example: ["m" => links with -lm, "dl" => links with -ldl]
libs = ["argtable2"]

# Note: All paths are relative to this configuration file's location
# ======================================================
# Automatic Behavior:
# - If 'src' is omitted: automatically searches in ./src/
# - If 'include' is omitted: automatically searches in ./include/
# - Empty arrays [] will use defaults, commented-out fields will use defaults
