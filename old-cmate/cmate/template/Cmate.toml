# Project configuration file (auto-generated by 'cmate --init')
# ======================================================
# Each [[bin]] table defines a build target (executable project).
# You can define multiple [[bin]] tables for multiple binaries.

[[bin]]
# [Required] Project name (used for executable name)
project = ""

# [Required] C compiler to use (gcc/clang/etc)
# Use "auto" to automatically detect the host's default C compiler,
# or leave unspecified to use the default compiler.
compiler = "auto"

# Compiler flags for compilation phase
# Include warnings, language standards, preprocessor definitions, etc.
# Note: Do not include optimization flags or linker-specific options here
flags = "-Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -g"

# Linker flags for linking phase
# Include optimization flags, link-time optimization, and linker-specific options
# Uncomment and customize as needed for your project requirements
# linkflags = [
#     "-O2",        # Optimization level 2
#     "-s"          # Strip debug symbols (for release builds)
# ]

# Source directories containing .c files
# Default: ["src"] (if not specified)
# Multiple directories can be specified as an array
# Uncomment and modify to customize source directories
# src = ["src"]

# Include directories containing .h files
# Default: ["include"] (if not specified)
# Multiple directories can be specified as an array
# Uncomment and modify to customize include directories
# include = ["include"]

# [Advanced] Specific files to compile (overrides automatic src discovery)
# Use this to compile particular files when auto-detection isn't desired
# Leave empty [] to use automatic source file discovery from 'src' directories
# Example: ["src/main.c", "src/utils.c"]
compile = []

# External libraries to link against
# Library names without the 'lib' prefix and '.so/.a' suffix
# The '-l' flag will be added automatically during linking
# Example: ["m"] => links with -lm (math library)
#          ["dl"] => links with -ldl (dynamic linking library)
#          ["pthread"] => links with -lpthread (POSIX threads)
libs = []

# ======================================================
# Configuration Guidelines:
#
# Development vs Release Builds:
# - Development: Keep '-g' in flags for debugging symbols
# - Release: Move optimization to linkflags, consider adding '-s'
#
# Common Compiler Flags:
# - "-Wall -Wextra": Enable comprehensive warnings
# - "-std=c99": Use C99 standard (or c11, c17, c23)
# - "-g": Include debugging information
# - "-DDEBUG": Define DEBUG macro for debug builds
#
# Common Linker Flags:
# - "-O2" or "-O3": Optimization levels for release builds
# - "-s": Strip debug symbols to reduce binary size
# - "-static": Static linking (increases binary size but removes dependencies)
# - "-flto": Link-time optimization for better performance
#
# Path Resolution:
# - All paths are relative to this configuration file's location
# - Use forward slashes (/) for cross-platform compatibility
#
# Automatic Behavior:
# - If 'src' is omitted: automatically searches in ./src/
# - If 'include' is omitted: automatically searches in ./include/
# - Empty arrays [] will use default behavior
# - Commented-out fields will use default values
